Hi! My name is Cory Helms. This repository will serve as a portfolio for projects that I have either worked on myself or with a group.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I will finish my Bachelor’s Degree in Informatics in May 2021. I will also have a minor in Cybersecurity. Additionally, I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Affairs from Indiana University, which I obtained in May 2012. In the time between both of my degrees I spent over 5 years working at Indiana University in a variety of roles related to undergraduate admissions. I started as a part-time admissions assistant and worked my up into a business development role where I audited data to ensure its integrity.

As for my programming experience, I have over 2 years experience with Python and web design languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also have a year of experience with C. While spending a year working on a capstone project I was able to develop my skills using PHP and MySQL. In my experience, I am a quick learner when it comes to programming and I am confident in my ability to become an effective team member no matter which language I need to program with.

With regard to my Cybersecurity experience, my background is primarily blue team focused. Almost all of my security coursework was focused on defense and intrusion detection. I became very familiar with a command line interface, both Linux and Windows based, and have a basic understanding of PowerShell. Additionally, I am familiar with networking tools like Wireshark and Snort, and have experience with packet filtering while using iptables. I am comfortable configuring access controls for users from both the command line and Active Directory. I also have experience configuring servers and databases while utilizing the LAMP stack.

Working in Cybersecurity is my ultimate goal, and I think my previous work experience and passion for Cybersecurity make me a great candidate for your organization. 

I hope you have a great day!
